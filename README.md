## Haraj Challenge
Welcome to Haraj challenge!

In this repository you will find a sample app ready for implementation. 

You will find icons and a json file containing the data you'll need to complete this challenge.


## Your Mission

Create a functional app with two screens to display information about Posts from Haraj website.

First, a screen showing a list of Posts from the json file you'll find in `assets` folder.

<img src="image1.png" height="450" alt="First Screen">

Second, a screen that displays the information of a particular Post upon click events on the previous screen's list.
